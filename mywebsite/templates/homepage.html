                    When it comes to hobbies, althought I have a lot of them, like most people do, I usually go for the same three, which are <mark class="blue">video games</mark>, <mark class="blue">movies or tv series</mark> and working on my <mark class="blue">project ideias or coding</mark>. I don't like to play single player games so I only go online when my friends are on discord, and when my girlfriend is at home we usually watch some Netflix and althought is not that often, we recently started to assemble puzzles. Since I moved to Lisbon, when i'm alone and I don't feel like playing, i've been enjoying myself working on my own projects/ideias.

                I've always loved to do coding projects and participate on hackathons and engineering competitions during my journey in college, however, and spite of having a lot of cool ideas, i've never really dedicated myself to my own mini projects. That changed a little bit in 2021 Spring. Being locked down by the covid-19 pandemic and unhappy with my job at the time, this was a way of keep learning about the things that I like. I plan on keep working on my own ideas and this section will serve as a blog for that.
